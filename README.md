# LoopColors
Simple script to make a video looping colours of a pallette

# What is this?
This started to proof my argument to a friend (and others on the net) that the animation in this gif:

is nothing to do with the animated part on the bottom right, but JUST about **how** the colours loop between borders and main. So 
# I just did an svg image with a rocket with three colours. 
# then I made a bmp file with it
# I made a script that replaces each of those colors by one of the looping colors
# created a video with ffmpeg
# voil√† 
It looks like two rockets getting closer but also rotating.

# ... (really?)
Well, cmon, it was a hollyday today. 

# yea sure... How I make one with these scripts?

Just be sure you have python and ffmpeg. Then just run:
```
